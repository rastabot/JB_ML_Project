Instructions:

1. Download/clone the repo
2. extract Randomfores_gs from the rar file
3. Run the main.py

the script will run, load the  3 models ,run the cross-validation scores
and test the models with the test set.

* The data set is  "adult.data" -  downloaded form the link above
* I trained 3 models Decission trees, Random Forests and Neural Networks using GridSearchCV
* The test scores and confusion matrixes are shown in the prompt, what is interesting is that the model scores converge around 0.84
* at the end of the script some graphs from the data set research can be shown
